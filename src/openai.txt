https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
Creates a model response for the given chat conversation. Learn more in the text generation, vision, and audio guides.

Parameter support can differ depending on the model used to generate the response, particularly for newer reasoning models. Parameters that are only supported for reasoning models are noted below. For the current state of unsupported parameters in reasoning models, refer to the reasoning guide.

Request body
messages
array

Required
A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. Depending on the model you use, different message types (modalities) are supported, like text, images, and audio.


Show possible types
model
string

Required
ID of the model to use. See the model endpoint compatibility table for details on which models work with the Chat API.

store
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for use in our model distillation or evals products.

reasoning_effort
string

Optional
Defaults to medium
o1 models only

Constrains effort on reasoning for reasoning models. Currently supported values are low, medium, and high. Reducing reasoning effort can result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

metadata
object or null

Optional
Developer-defined tags and values used for filtering completions in the dashboard.

frequency_penalty
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 0
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

logit_bias
map

Optional
Defaults to null
Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

logprobs
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the content of message.

top_logprobs
integer or null

Optional
An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. logprobs must be set to true if this parameter is used.

max_tokens
Deprecated
integer or null

Optional
The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. This value can be used to control costs for text generated via API.

This value is now deprecated in favor of max_completion_tokens, and is not compatible with o1 series models.

max_completion_tokens
integer or null

Optional
An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion, including visible output tokens and reasoning tokens.

n
integer or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep n as 1 to minimize costs.

modalities
array or null

Optional
Output types that you would like the model to generate for this request. Most models are capable of generating text, which is the default:

["text"]

The gpt-4o-audio-preview model can also be used to generate audio. To request that this model generate both text and audio responses, you can use:

["text", "audio"]

prediction
object

Optional
Configuration for a Predicted Output, which can greatly improve response times when large parts of the model response are known ahead of time. This is most common when you are regenerating a file with only minor changes to most of the content.


Show possible types
audio
object or null

Optional
Parameters for audio output. Required when audio output is requested with modalities: ["audio"]. Learn more.


Show properties
presence_penalty
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 0
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

response_format
object

Optional
An object specifying the format that the model must output.

Setting to { "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} } enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the Structured Outputs guide.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

Important: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.


Show possible types
seed
integer or null

Optional
This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the system_fingerprint response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

service_tier
string or null

Optional
Defaults to auto
Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.
stop
string / array / null

Optional
Defaults to null
Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

stream
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message. Example Python code.

stream_options
object or null

Optional
Defaults to null
Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set stream: true.


Show properties
temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

top_p
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

tools
array

Optional
A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.


Show properties
tool_choice
string or object

Optional
Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. none means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message. auto means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. required means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}} forces the model to call that tool.

none is the default when no tools are present. auto is the default if tools are present.


Show possible types
parallel_tool_calls
boolean

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

user
string

Optional
A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.

function_call
Deprecated
string or object

Optional
Deprecated in favor of tool_choice.

Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.

none means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message.

auto means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function.

Specifying a particular function via {"name": "my_function"} forces the model to call that function.

none is the default when no functions are present. auto is the default if functions are present.


Show possible types
functions
Deprecated
array

Optional
Deprecated in favor of tools.

A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.


Show properties
Returns
Returns a chat completion object, or a streamed sequence of chat completion chunk objects if the request is streamed.

Structured Outputs

Copy page
Ensure responses adhere to a JSON schema.
Try it out
Try it out in the Playground or generate a ready-to-use schema definition to experiment with structured outputs.


Generate
Introduction
JSON is one of the most widely used formats in the world for applications to exchange data.

Structured Outputs is a feature that ensures the model will always generate responses that adhere to your supplied JSON Schema, so you don't need to worry about the model omitting a required key, or hallucinating an invalid enum value.

Some benefits of Structured Outputs include:

Reliable type-safety: No need to validate or retry incorrectly formatted responses
Explicit refusals: Safety-based model refusals are now programmatically detectable
Simpler prompting: No need for strongly worded prompts to achieve consistent formatting
In addition to supporting JSON Schema in the REST API, the OpenAI SDKs for Python and JavaScript also make it easy to define object schemas using Pydantic and Zod respectively. Below, you can see how to extract information from unstructured text that conforms to a schema defined in code.

Getting a structured response

from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

class CalendarEvent(BaseModel):
    name: str
    date: str
    participants: list[str]

completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Extract the event information."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Alice and Bob are going to a science fair on Friday."},
    ],
    response_format=CalendarEvent,
)

event = completion.choices[0].message.parsed
Supported models
Structured Outputs are available in our latest large language models, starting with GPT-4o:

o1-2024-12-17 and later
gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 and later
gpt-4o-2024-08-06 and later
Older models like gpt-4-turbo and earlier may use JSON mode instead.

When to use Structured Outputs via function calling vs via response_format

Structured Outputs is available in two forms in the OpenAI API:

When using function calling
When using a json_schema response format
Function calling is useful when you are building an application that bridges the models and functionality of your application.

For example, you can give the model access to functions that query a database in order to build an AI assistant that can help users with their orders, or functions that can interact with the UI.

Conversely, Structured Outputs via response_format are more suitable when you want to indicate a structured schema for use when the model responds to the user, rather than when the model calls a tool.

For example, if you are building a math tutoring application, you might want the assistant to respond to your user using a specific JSON Schema so that you can generate a UI that displays different parts of the model's output in distinct ways.

Put simply:

If you are connecting the model to tools, functions, data, etc. in your system, then you should use function calling
If you want to structure the model's output when it responds to the user, then you should use a structured response_format
The remainder of this guide will focus on non-function calling use cases in the Chat Completions API. To learn more about how to use Structured Outputs with function calling, check out the Function Calling guide.

Structured Outputs vs JSON mode
Structured Outputs is the evolution of JSON mode. While both ensure valid JSON is produced, only Structured Outputs ensure schema adherance. Both Structured Outputs and JSON mode are supported in the Chat Completions API, Assistants API, Fine-tuning API and Batch API.

We recommend always using Structured Outputs instead of JSON mode when possible.

However, Structured Outputs with response_format: {type: "json_schema", ...} is only supported with the gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, and gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model snapshots and later.

Structured Outputs	JSON Mode
Outputs valid JSON	Yes	Yes
Adheres to schema	Yes (see supported schemas)	No
Compatible models	gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-2024-08-06, and later	gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-* and gpt-4o-* models
Enabling	response_format: { type: "json_schema", json_schema: {"strict": true, "schema": ...} }	response_format: { type: "json_object" }
Examples
Chain of thought
You can ask the model to output an answer in a structured, step-by-step way, to guide the user through the solution.

Structured Outputs for chain-of-thought math tutoring

from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class MathReasoning(BaseModel):
    steps: list[Step]
    final_answer: str

completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
    ],
    response_format=MathReasoning,
)

math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message.parsed
Example response

{
  "steps": [
    {
      "explanation": "Start with the equation 8x + 7 = -23.",
      "output": "8x + 7 = -23"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with the variable.",
      "output": "8x = -23 - 7"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Simplify the right side of the equation.",
      "output": "8x = -30"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Divide both sides by 8 to solve for x.",
      "output": "x = -30 / 8"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Simplify the fraction.",
      "output": "x = -15 / 4"
    }
  ],
  "final_answer": "x = -15 / 4"
}
How to use Structured Outputs with response_format

You can use Structured Outputs with the new SDK helper to parse the model's output into your desired format, or you can specify the JSON schema directly.

Note: the first request you make with any schema will have additional latency as our API processes the schema, but subsequent requests with the same schema will not have additional latency.

Step 1: Define your object
Step 2: Supply your object in the API call
Step 3: Handle edge cases
Refusals with Structured Outputs

When using Structured Outputs with user-generated input, OpenAI models may occasionally refuse to fulfill the request for safety reasons. Since a refusal does not necessarily follow the schema you have supplied in response_format, the API response will include a new field called refusal to indicate that the model refused to fulfill the request.

When the refusal property appears in your output object, you might present the refusal in your UI, or include conditional logic in code that consumes the response to handle the case of a refused request.


class Step(BaseModel):
  explanation: str
  output: str

class MathReasoning(BaseModel):
  steps: list[Step]
  final_answer: str

completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
  model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages=[
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
  ],
  response_format=MathReasoning,
)

math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message

# If the model refuses to respond, you will get a refusal message
if (math_reasoning.refusal):
  print(math_reasoning.refusal)
else:
  print(math_reasoning.parsed)
The API response from a refusal will look something like this:


{
"id": "chatcmpl-9nYAG9LPNonX8DAyrkwYfemr3C8HC",
"object": "chat.completion",
"created": 1721596428,

}

    }
},

}
Tips and best practices

Handling user-generated input
If your application is using user-generated input, make sure your prompt includes instructions on how to handle situations where the input cannot result in a valid response.

The model will always try to adhere to the provided schema, which can result in hallucinations if the input is completely unrelated to the schema.

You could include language in your prompt to specify that you want to return empty parameters, or a specific sentence, if the model detects that the input is incompatible with the task.

Handling mistakes
Structured Outputs can still contain mistakes. If you see mistakes, try adjusting your instructions, providing examples in the system instructions, or splitting tasks into simpler subtasks. Refer to the prompt engineering guide for more guidance on how to tweak your inputs.

Avoid JSON schema divergence
To prevent your JSON Schema and corresponding types in your programming language from diverging, we strongly recommend using the native Pydantic/zod sdk support.

If you prefer to specify the JSON schema directly, you could add CI rules that flag when either the JSON schema or underlying data objects are edited, or add a CI step that auto-generates the JSON Schema from type definitions (or vice-versa).

Streaming
You can use streaming to process model responses or function call arguments as they are being generated, and parse them as structured data.

That way, you don't have to wait for the entire response to complete before handling it. This is particularly useful if you would like to display JSON fields one by one, or handle function call arguments as soon as they are available.

We recommend relying on the SDKs to handle streaming with Structured Outputs. You can find an example of how to stream function call arguments without the SDK stream helper in the function calling guide.

Here is how you can stream a model response with the stream helper:


from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

class EntitiesModel(BaseModel):
  attributes: List[str]
  colors: List[str]
  animals: List[str]

client = OpenAI()

with client.beta.chat.completions.stream(
  model="gpt-4o",
  messages=[
      {"role": "system", "content": "Extract entities from the input text"},
      {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog with piercing blue eyes",
      },
  ],
  response_format=EntitiesModel,
) as stream:
  for event in stream:
      if event.type == "content.delta":
          if event.parsed is not None:
              # Print the parsed data as JSON
              print("content.delta parsed:", event.parsed)
      elif event.type == "content.done":
          print("content.done")
      elif event.type == "error":
          print("Error in stream:", event.error)

final_completion = stream.get_final_completion()
print("Final completion:", final_completion)
You can also use the stream helper to parse function call arguments:


from pydantic import BaseModel
import openai
from openai import OpenAI

class GetWeather(BaseModel):
  city: str
  country: str

client = OpenAI()

with client.beta.chat.completions.stream(
  model="gpt-4o",
  messages=[
      {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What's the weather like in SF and London?",
      },
  ],
  tools=[
      openai.pydantic_function_tool(GetWeather, name="get_weather"),
  ],
  parallel_tool_calls=True,
) as stream:
  for event in stream:
      if event.type == "tool_calls.function.arguments.delta" or event.type == "tool_calls.function.arguments.done":
          print(event)

print(stream.get_final_completion())
Supported schemas
Structured Outputs supports a subset of the JSON Schema language.

Supported types
The following types are supported for Structured Outputs:

String
Number
Boolean
Integer
Object
Array
Enum
anyOf
Root objects must not be anyOf
Note that the root level object of a schema must be an object, and not use anyOf. A pattern that appears in Zod (as one example) is using a discriminated union, which produces an anyOf at the top level. So code such as the following won't work:


import { z } from 'zod';
import { zodResponseFormat } from 'openai/helpers/zod';

const BaseResponseSchema = z.object({ /* ... */ });
const UnsuccessfulResponseSchema = z.object({ /* ... */ });

const finalSchema = z.discriminatedUnion('status', [
  BaseResponseSchema,
  UnsuccessfulResponseSchema,
]);

// Invalid JSON Schema for Structured Outputs
const json = zodResponseFormat(finalSchema, 'final_schema');
All fields must be required
To use Structured Outputs, all fields or function parameters must be specified as required.


{
  "name": "get_weather",
  "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
  "strict": true,
  "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
          "location": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "The location to get the weather for"
          },
          "unit": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
              "enum": ["F", "C"]
          }
      },
      "additionalProperties": false,
      "required": ["location", "unit"]
  }
}
Although all fields must be required (and the model will return a value for each parameter), it is possible to emulate an optional parameter by using a union type with null.


{
  "name": "get_weather",
  "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
  "strict": true,
  "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
          "location": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "The location to get the weather for"
          },
          "unit": {
              "type": ["string", "null"],
              "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
              "enum": ["F", "C"]
          }
      },
      "additionalProperties": false,
      "required": [
          "location", "unit"
      ]
  }
}
Objects have limitations on nesting depth and size
A schema may have up to 100 object properties total, with up to 5 levels of nesting.

Limitations on total string size
In a schema, total string length of all property names, definition names, enum values, and const values cannot exceed 15,000 characters.

Limitations on enum size
A schema may have up to 500 enum values across all enum properties.

For a single enum property with string values, the total string length of all enum values cannot exceed 7,500 characters when there are more than 250 enum values.

additionalProperties: false must always be set in objects
additionalProperties controls whether it is allowable for an object to contain additional keys / values that were not defined in the JSON Schema.

Structured Outputs only supports generating specified keys / values, so we require developers to set additionalProperties: false to opt into Structured Outputs.


{
  "name": "get_weather",
  "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
  "strict": true,
  "schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
          "location": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "The location to get the weather for"
          },
          "unit": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
              "enum": ["F", "C"]
          }
      },
      "additionalProperties": false,
      "required": [
          "location", "unit"
      ]
  }
}
Key ordering
When using Structured Outputs, outputs will be produced in the same order as the ordering of keys in the schema.

Some type-specific keywords are not yet supported
Notable keywords not supported include:

For strings: minLength, maxLength, pattern, format
For numbers: minimum, maximum, multipleOf
For objects: patternProperties, unevaluatedProperties, propertyNames, minProperties, maxProperties
For arrays: unevaluatedItems, contains, minContains, maxContains, minItems, maxItems, uniqueItems
If you turn on Structured Outputs by supplying strict: true and call the API with an unsupported JSON Schema, you will receive an error.

For anyOf, the nested schemas must each be a valid JSON Schema per this subset
Here's an example supported anyOf schema:


{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
      "item": {
          "anyOf": [
              {
                  "type": "object",
                  "description": "The user object to insert into the database",
                  "properties": {
                      "name": {
                          "type": "string",
                          "description": "The name of the user"
                      },
                      "age": {
                          "type": "number",
                          "description": "The age of the user"
                      }
                  },
                  "additionalProperties": false,
                  "required": [
                      "name",
                      "age"
                  ]
              },
              {
                  "type": "object",
                  "description": "The address object to insert into the database",
                  "properties": {
                      "number": {
                          "type": "string",
                          "description": "The number of the address. Eg. for 123 main st, this would be 123"
                      },
                      "street": {
                          "type": "string",
                          "description": "The street name. Eg. for 123 main st, this would be main st"
                      },
                      "city": {
                          "type": "string",
                          "description": "The city of the address"
                      }
                  },
                  "additionalProperties": false,
                  "required": [
                      "number",
                      "street",
                      "city"
                  ]
              }
          ]
      }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "required": [
      "item"
  ]
}
Definitions are supported
You can use definitions to define subschemas which are referenced throughout your schema. The following is a simple example.


{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
      "steps": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
              "$ref": "#/$defs/step"
          }
      },
      "final_answer": {
          "type": "string"
      }
  },
  "$defs": {
      "step": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
              "explanation": {
                  "type": "string"
              },
              "output": {
                  "type": "string"
              }
          },
          "required": [
              "explanation",
              "output"
          ],
          "additionalProperties": false
      }
  },
  "required": [
      "steps",
      "final_answer"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
Recursive schemas are supported
Sample recursive schema using # to indicate root recursion.


{
  "name": "ui",
  "description": "Dynamically generated UI",
  "strict": true,
  "schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {

              "description": "The type of the UI component",
              "enum": ["div", "button", "header", "section", "field", "form"]
          },
          "label": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "The label of the UI component, used for buttons or form fields"
          },
          "children": {

              "description": "Nested UI components",
              "items": {

              }
          },
          "attributes": {
              "type": "array",
              "description": "Arbitrary attributes for the UI component, suitable for any element",
              "items": {

                  "properties": {
                      "name": {
                          "type": "string",
                          "description": "The name of the attribute, for example onClick or className"
                      },
                      "value": {
                          "type": "string",
                          "description": "The value of the attribute"
                      }
                  },
                  "additionalProperties": false,
                  "required": ["name", "value"]
              }
          }
      },
      "required": ["type", "label", "children", "attributes"],
      "additionalProperties": false
  }
}
Sample recursive schema using explicit recursion:


{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
      "linked_list": {
          "$ref": "#/$defs/linked_list_node"
      }
  },
  "$defs": {
      "linked_list_node": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
              "value": {
                  "type": "number"
              },
              "next": {
                  "anyOf": [
                      {
                          "$ref": "#/$defs/linked_list_node"
                      },
                      {
                          "type": "null"
                      }
                  ]
              }
          },
          "additionalProperties": false,
          "required": [
              "next",
              "value"
          ]
      }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "required": [
      "linked_list"
  ]
}
JSON mode
JSON mode is a more basic version of the Structured Outputs feature. While JSON mode ensures that model output is valid JSON, Structured Outputs reliably matches the model's output to the schema you specify. We recommend you use Structured Outputs if it is supported for your use case.

When JSON mode is turned on, the model's output is ensured to be valid JSON, except for in some edge cases that you should detect and handle appropriately.

To turn on JSON mode with the Chat Completions or Assistants API you can set the response_format to { "type": "json_object" }. If you are using function calling, JSON mode is always turned on.

Important notes:

When using JSON mode, you must always instruct the model to produce JSON via some message in the conversation, for example via your system message. If you don't include an explicit instruction to generate JSON, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace and the request may run continually until it reaches the token limit. To help ensure you don't forget, the API will throw an error if the string "JSON" does not appear somewhere in the context.
JSON mode will not guarantee the output matches any specific schema, only that it is valid and parses without errors. You should use Structured Outputs to ensure it matches your schema, or if that is not possible, you should use a validation library and potentially retries to ensure that the output matches your desired schema.
Your application must detect and handle the edge cases that can result in the model output not being a complete JSON object (see below)
