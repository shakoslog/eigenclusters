    "description": "This cluster represents the foundational epistemological project of the rationalist sphere: the systematic identification and mitigation of cognitive biases using Bayesian inference as the gold standard for reasoning. It encapsulates the transition from 'bias' as a social slur to 'bias' as a predictable, mathematical error in cognitive processing (heuristics). At its peak, this cluster treated self-improvement not as a therapeutic journey but as an engineering problem, where the human mind (the 'map') must be rigorously updated to match reality (the 'territory') through evidence processing. It includes the 'Sequences,' the study of heuristics, and the pursuit of 'sanity' defined as probability calibration.",

It defines itself against the prevailing 'folk rationality' of the early 2000s blogosphere, insisting on mathematical rigor over rhetorical skill. The energy is formative and evangelical, driven by the belief that human disagreement is largely a failure of probability processing.",

    "description": "This cluster tracks the economic structure of the rationalist sphere: the transition from a decentralized 'gift economy' of bloggers to a centralized 'patronage economy' funded by a handful of billionaires (Peter Thiel, Dustin Moskovitz, Sam Bankman-Fried). It posits that 'Independence' is a myth and that intellectual work requires a 'Patron' to protect it from the 'Mob' (the Market or the Mob). This structure revived the Renaissance model of the 'Court Philosopher.' The trajectory moves from the 'PayPal Mafia' diaspora to the 'Effective Altruism' grant-making monopsony, culminating in the competing 'Tech Courts' of the 2020s.",
