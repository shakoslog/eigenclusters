It captures the transition from liberal normalcy to a 'state of exception' characterized by lockdowns, mandates, surveillance, and the moralization of hygiene. It includes the rise of the 'essential worker' category, the quantification of health (testing, case counts), and the eventual fracturing of this consensus into endemic fatigue. It is not merely the virus itself, but the totalizing cultural and political superstructure built to manage it.",
