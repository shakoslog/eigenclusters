It captures the transition from narrative history to statistical regression, encompassing the rise of biometrics, sociometrics, econometrics, and eventually computational social science. The cluster tracks the oscillation between high-modernist confidence in social engineering and the postmodern skepticism of 'objective' numbers.",

The motion here is foundational; the catalyst was the widespread adoption of Karl Pearson's statistical methods, which promised to transform sociology from philosophy into a 'grammar of science.' This period marked a departure from 19th-century moral philosophy toward a cold, numerical assessment of human populations, heavily influenced by eugenicist thought that sought to quantify human 'fitness' as a manageable variable.",

The shift from vague notions of 'character' to the specific, measurable 'IQ' represents a critical hardening of social epistemology. This era saw the tools of quantification move from observation to classification, as Binet's scales were rapidly adapted for institutional use.

The 'Army Alpha' tests represented a massive leap in applied psychometrics, moving quantitative assessment from the clinic to the population level.

The publication of 'Statistical Methods for Research Workers' was the primary catalyst, creating a universal language (p-values, ANOVA) that all social sciences began to mimic to gain legitimacy.
